Priming and Specificity Effects of Lexical Accent in Spanish Words: Examining the Lateralization.

Materials. 
The stimuli consisted of 40 Spanish spoken words and 40 spoken nonwords. 
All stimuli were composed of three syllables (trisyllabic) and 5-8 letters. 
The lexical items were common Spanish words selected from the database EsPal (www.bcbl.eu/databases/espal/ ; Duchon, Perea, Sebastián-Gallés, Martí, & Carreiras, 2013), whose mean lexical frequency was 16 per million (log 1.53). 
They were 10 control words (unprimed) and 30 experimental words (primed). 
Control words consisted of three words with lexical accent on the last syllable (agudas, in Spanish), four words with lexical accent on the penultimate syllable (llanas), and three words with lexical accent on the penultimate syllable (esdrújulas). 
Experimental words consisted of ten ‘agudas’, ten ‘llanas’, and ten ‘esdrújulas’. Nonwords were created by changing one phoneme from real and common trisyllabic Spanish words (not included in the experimental set) with lexical accent on different syllables.

All stimuli were recorded in a sound-attenuated room by a male talker and digitized at a sampling rate of 44,100 Hz using a 16-bit analog-to-digital converter. 
Then they were edited into individual wav sound files, converted to mp3 format, and stored for later playback. All audio files were equated in root mean square (RMS) amplitude.2
